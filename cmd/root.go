	Short: "A web crawler for artist data",
	Long: `Crawl is a command-line application that fetches and stores artist data.
	It uses web scraping techniques to gather data from various online sources,
	and stores the data in a local SQLite database for further analysis and processing.

	Example usage:

	crawl createdb  # Create a new database with the provided schema
	crawl fetch https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
func Execute() {
	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

func init() {
	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.
	// Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.crawl.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
	rootCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
